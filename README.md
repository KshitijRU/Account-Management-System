# Account-Management-System
Account Management System covers a Stock Account and a Bank Account. The user can perfrom transactions, keep track of them as well.
The Bank Account part of the code performs deposit, withdraw operations and also displays the current transaction details.
The Stock Account requests the user to input a ticker and provides the user options to either buy or sell shares. The user can keep track of their portfolio as well current account balance. 
I have made use of Design patterns such as declaring functions as virtual ( polymorphism), wrappers and decorators such as sorting.
The user is also provided an option to plot a portfolio graph from the portfolio file that stores the user's transaction record. The code has a mention of the MATLAB code in the mainkshitij.cpp. For interfacing MATLAB with Visual Studio C++, it was a hassale and took sometime.
